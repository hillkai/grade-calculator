# grade-calculator
A C++ program to figure out a grade in a class. This program does not use C++ in an object-oriented manner. This assignment uses functions,
loops and conditionals to come up with the overall grade. A user can put grades in for tests, assignments, labs, and recitaions. The user 
can also chose to not insert grades for a specific category. To run this program all the user has to do is compile and run in the terminal.
